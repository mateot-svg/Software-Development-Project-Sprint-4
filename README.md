# Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is a tool to visualize and analyze vehicle data using various interactive plots. The main functionalities include histograms of vehicle prices, scatter plots of price vs odometer, and custom histograms for selected features.

## Description

The Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard is designed to help users understand vehicle data trends through interactive visualizations. It is built using the following libraries:
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating interactive plots.

## Features

1. **Data Viewer**: Display the vehicle dataset in a table format.
2. **Histogram of Vehicle Prices**: Interactive histogram of vehicle prices colored by manufacturer.
3. **Scatter Plot of Price vs Odometer**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between vehicle price and odometer readings, colored by condition.
4. **Custom Histogram**: Create custom histograms for selected numerical features.
